# FunKii_GUI edit and redistribution
Redistribution of FunKii-GUI. Edited and cleaned up by me into a single .py file. I did not create the base program, however I did edit it majorly

credits go to  cearp for writing the original FunKiiU, cerealkiller for the re-write. And dojafoja for creating the original FunKii-UI which inspired this project for someone else to create (I can't find or have forgotten the creator of the Front-End but credits to them as well)

to run project simply type "python GUI.py" in cmd prompt, or command line. Go to settings and edit the download directory because it's still saved from the one I tested with.
