# FunKii-UI-front-end-redistro
This is a redistrubution of the FunKii-UI front-end. I did not in any way create the program, credits go to  cearp for writing the original FunKiiU, cerealkiller for the re-write. And dojafoja for creating the original FunKii-UI which inspired this project for someone else to create (I can't find or have forgotten the creator of the Front-End but credits to them as well)

guide to run: download the zip of the repo and unzip it to anywhere you like. Open the folder and go to /src and run "frontend.py" and the GUI should appear. Note: the titlekeys.json is already provided, so in theory it should load titles without needing a valid *title key site*
